# API

## postman

API: is a interface to a server which has some data

### postman

postman is a tool for interacting with web based api. Api is just like an outlet that the server offers. just like we plug we used postman to get data(electricity) but instead of using physical cable we use internet

Before using the api read the documentation about the api, what information it has, how to interact with it, doc explains how to use it

go to workspace of the postman
workspace-->myworkspace
open a new tab
paste the address (if you want to check if everything is working write "/status" after the link) if everything is fine the status will be 'ok'
hit the send button

### HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol

https: hypertext transfer protocol secure

In our communication between client and server we are using HTTP

#### the message that goes from client to the server is called "Request"

#### and what is coming back from the server is called "Response"

The upper part of the postman is "Request" section
The lower part is about "Response"
